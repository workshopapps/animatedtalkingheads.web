          The problem we have identified in this creative industry is the lack of variety in podcast
          marketing. Podcast creators are finding it increasingly difficult to craft a great
          strategy.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
          The boring pattern goes something like this: start a podcast, publish content, and share
          links and videos that lack visuals. Rinse and repeat. We are here to help. What we want to
          do is simply empower podcast creators to unlock new ways to unleash their creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create fun cartoon videos that feature actual talking heads.</li>
            <li>Ditch AI voice. Upload your audio and use your real voice.</li>

        <p>
          But there's still a problem: that pattern is old. And you wonder why your podcast does not
          attract new listeners? How does your content reach people where they are? Your potential
          audiences are not hanging around Spotify waiting for your next episode to drop. They are
          on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. Bring your content to them
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Create a talking heads video using Voxclips in four simple steps:</li>
          <li>Upload your audio podcast.</li>
          <li>Choose options for your avatar.</li>
          <li>Customize your video background using the pre-installed settings.</li>
          <li>Preview and download your video.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Now, share your video on various social platforms. Podcasters can now generate cartoon
          videos with talking heads from their podcasts and share to video-sharing platforms like
          YouTube and TikTok. You can monetize these audiences while growing your podcast brand on
          other platforms. This will enable you to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li> Repurpose your podcast content.</li>
          <li> Become proactive sharing on multiple platforms at the same time. </li>
          <li> Reach more people organically, </li>
          <li> Build fans and grow your brand. </li>
